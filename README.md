Haar Cascade Inverter
=====================

Script to invert an OpenCV Haar cascade. For example, when passed a cascade
file that would normally detect human faces in an image, it will instead
generate an image of a human face.

See [this blog post](http://matthewearl.github.io/2016/01/14/inverse-haar/) for
an overview of how the code works.
